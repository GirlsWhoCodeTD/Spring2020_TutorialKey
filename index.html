      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      
      <p>HTML is the hidden language of the web that uses tags to create page structure. Because there is SO MUCH you can do with HTML, it is unrealistic to expect anyone to be able to learn it all in a 10 week session, but we are going to do our best.</p>

        <h3>How do I make my site do things?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Javascript gives our website functionality. Many web based games are written in Javascript. If you've ever filled out an online form, Javascript is how the website processes your information.</li>
          <li>The stuff below is set using Javascript!</li>
        </ol>
        <span id="dynamicText"></span>
